# Colorful Traccking Trail 
_Rebecca Marconi_
_Made with Processing_


This program aims to show the movement of subjects through a space. The code tracks the movement of a subject through the camera and leaves an echo of their displacement. This code is meant to run in an open space where people are walking by. After a subject walks by the camera, the screen will continue repeat their motion in a colorful shadow. This project will bring all of the inhabitants of the space together on the screen, as people walk by their shadows will all accumulate to show a busy hallway.
